# Welcome!

This is the personal site for [Sander Moolin](https://sandermoolin.com), web and game programmer.

I wanted to make this site an example of some of the work I enjoy doing, including games, SVG animations, and responsive, accessible design. I also wanted to host some content only accessible via `dat://`, which is where my [blog](https://sandermoolin.com/blog) comes in!

I believe very strongly that p2p browsing and a less centralized power structure is critical to the future of the Internet. I'm writing this just a few days after Trump and Pai's FCC voted down net neutrality in the United States, so I and the rest of my country are very much focused on next steps - and the protocols for a decentralized Internet are one of those steps with which I can help.
