title: Hello, world!

Hey! This is Sander Moolin ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/sandermoolin), [Github](https://github.com/safrmo)) - I'm really excited by the idea of working on a more decentralized web, especially with the recent vote to repeal net neutrality in the United States.

I'm a programmer at [Funkhaus](http://funkhaus.us), where I work mainly with Vue.js and WordPress. I've [worked](http://www.its3am.com/) on [several](http://resourcela.com) [sites](http://carbonvfx.com) that I'm really proud of with Funkhaus, and in my spare time, I like to program games in Vue (see my [Ludum Dare 40 entry](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/http-the-game)) and Phaser (see my [component library](https://github.com/safrmo/phaser-component-library)).

I'm very excited to learn more about Dat and Beaker, as well as other decentralized web technologies! Thanks so much to Leo Kewitz ([Github](https://github.com/kewitz/dat-medium), [Dat](dat://474b40995a22d1c89230c71d4b9e23c5dfc75ac78968f2f8f0030d494713d11b/)) for the easy Dat blog setup, and Andr√© Staltz ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrestaltz)) for writing [the article](https://staltz.com/a-plan-to-rescue-the-web-from-the-internet.html) that led me here!
