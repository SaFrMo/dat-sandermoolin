title: Fritter Mentions

Take a look at the updated to-do list for this week!

1. **Move my home server to a Raspberry Pi.**
1. **Continue work on an in-progress game.**
1. ~~**Finish the Fritter mentions feature.**~~

It's not necessarily "finished," but I just submitted [the new PR](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/fritter/pull/30) for mentions on Fritter. It's been a really educational experience so far, so I want to add a few notes on next steps:

1. **I'd like to learn more about how the Dat protocol works.** This may be a bit ambitious, so I'll probably need to start off by learning a bit more about networks and protocols in general, but I want to understand the technology behind p2p networks a bit better before I work on my next p2p project.
1. **I've been working on improving my git hygiene with this new PR, and I want to continue that improvement.** By this I mean that I'm trying to make my commit messages briefly sum up everything that's contained in the commit (not just "general fixes" or "WIP," for instance) and avoid adding/removing extra files. With the last PR to Fritter, I had a couple commits that would just fix a typo or remove a mistakenly added file; I want my commits to be of a higher quality than this, and to be easily cherry-pickable as well.

I'm sure there'll be more to do for the current PR, but it's always exciting to submit work! I'm looking forward to the next steps!
