title: Plans!

I've been starting off my days on [Fritter](dat://9900f9aad4d6e79e0beb1c46333852b99829e4dfcdfa9b690eeeab3c367c1b9a/) saying what I'm going to do in the coming day, so I thought I'd use this space to expand on those to-do lists. I'd like to talk about what I'm learning and what I'm working on so that I can get a clearer snapshot of my own growth as a developer.

Yesterday [I mentioned](dat://9900f9aad4d6e79e0beb1c46333852b99829e4dfcdfa9b690eeeab3c367c1b9a/thread/dat://14e02bfbe6d66113327a1e2f473dcd639dc3d9d97a05c1e5778a6c295fd02095/posts/0je4cpmjn.json) working on Fritter mentions in the morning, and I'm going to keep working on them this morning, based off of [this pull request](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/fritter/pull/28).

I'd like to do a few things with the rest of the week:

1. **Move my home server to a Raspberry Pi.** Right now it's hosted on a PC, which isn't ideal because of the power consumption involved and the Windows architecture. I got a Pi the other day, so I'd like to learn how to start working with one (and see if it can play into any of the decentralized internet tech I'm getting interested in!).
1. **Continue work on an in-progress game.** I reached out to an author about a year ago asking to use his idea in a video game, and work on that game has stalled in the past couple months. I'd like to dive back in and get working on it with a small team.
1. **Finish the Fritter mentions feature.** Mentions are a pretty core feature on social networks, so I want to finish up their implementation in Fritter.

Here goes!
