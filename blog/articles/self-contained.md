title: Pull request for a self-contained blog

I'm loving learning about Dat and some of the extremely powerful scripting available, so as my first little project, I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/kewitz/dat-medium/pull/10) for dat-medium, the code that powers this blog.

After working with a couple more examples, I'll write up some of what I've learned - developing for Dat, Beaker, and Dat-Medium should be as simple as possible, and I'd love to help with the documentation.

So far, though, it's an exciting protocol with exactly the kind of decentralized capabilities that can take some of the power away from giants like Google, Facebook, and the telecom companies. I'm very excited to learn more!
