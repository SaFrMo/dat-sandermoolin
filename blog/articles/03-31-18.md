title: Vegan Nutrition

I want to be more conscious about my nutrition as a vegan, so I'm taking a look around at some of the available resources. I've got a couple starting conditions, though:

* I'm looking for more whole foods than meat substitutes like Beyond Burger, Gardein, etc.
* I'd like to specifically plan out every single one of my meals for the next week, understanding the place that each food has in filling my nutrient needs.

The nutrition guide on the [Vegan Society site](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrition-overview) is the most promising outline I've found so far; there's also lots of good nutrient specifics on [International Vegan](https://www.internationalvegan.org/nutrition/#healthful-vegan-diet) and [The Plant Plate](http://www.theveganrd.com/vegan-nutrition-101/food-guide-for-vegans/) (see graphic below). I'm citing them below as VS (Vegan Society), IV (International Vegan), and PP (Plant Plate) below.

## The Nutrients
* **Legumes/Nuts/Seeds**
    * Servings: 4+ (IV), 4-5 (PP)
    * Examples
        * 1/2 cup cooked beans
        * 4 oz tofu/tempeh
        * 1 cup soy milk
        * 1 oz nuts/seeds
        * 2 tbsp nut/seed butter
* **Whole Grains**
    * Servings: 4-6+ (IV)
    * Note:

        > intact whole grains—such as brown rice, oats, wheat berries, millet, and quinoa—are nutritionally superior to whole grain flours and puffed or flaked whole grains (IV)

    * Examples
        * 1 slice bread
        * 1/2 cup cooked grains
        * 1 oz cereal
* **Vegetables**
    * Servings: 4+ (IV), 5+ (VS)
    * Examples
        * Leafy greens
        * Tomatoes
        * Carrots
        * Peppers
        * Broccoli
* **Fruit**
    * Servings: 2+ (IV), 3+ (PP)
    * Examples
        * Bananas
        * Apples
        * Oranges
        * Strawberries

## Next Steps
I'm going to start planning out meals using this information - I'm looking forward to making that happen next!

## Other Resources
* [Specific meal plans](https://veganhealth.org/meal-plans/) - I like that these are pre-made, but I'm a bit more excited about making my own.
*  - look at that neat graphic!

    Four or more servings of grains/starches, 3 or more of legumes, 1-2 of nuts and seeds, 3 or more of fruit, and 5 or more of vegetables, with salt, omega-3, and vitamin B12 on the side, and fortified almond milk and olive oil optional.
