title: First Impressions

Beaker, Dat, and p2p browsing seem like they're in a stage where they're ready for developers to come in and start fixing  problems - the underlying tech seems to be ready to use, but there are still plenty of barriers to entry for both tech-familiar and non-tech users.

I want to catalog a couple of my first impressions as a new Dat/Beaker user, before I get too used to the system that's already in place. My experience won't be unique, so I'd like to save some future effort by documenting that experience early on.

## Making the Tech Accessible
Developing a "killer app" seems like a natural next step for Dat, Beaker, and p2p browsing - the more users are on the p2p network, the better that network will be, and the more removed from monolithic power structures those users will be.

Beaker's "New Site" button is a fantastic idea, and makes for a really exciting first user experience - billing it as a more flexible and secure Geocities (and one that'll never be arbitrarily taken down) is something very understandable for my generation, born in the late 80's and early 90's.

I'd like to see the "New Site" button have some more non-tech options to start with. When you start a new site, the first thing you see is this:

As someone neck-deep in Atom all day, I love this window, but it's not the most approachable thing for a completely new user. Part of Geocities's appeal was that non-tech people could use it, so something a little more immediately relatable might be an exciting thing to see after you click "New Site."
